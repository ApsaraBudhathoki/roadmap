## Frontend Web Development Roadmap
In front-end web development, it basically concerns on appearance of website and its' working.

Firstly, you should learn HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### 1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is used to make the skeleton of website.
***

### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used for styling the webpage.
***

### 3. Javascript 
Javascript is used to make website interactive.
***

So now, we can compare HTML, CSS and Javascript with human body. HTML is like skeleton and organs like eyes, ear, etc. which forms the human body. In the same way, HTML forms the basic structure of the website. CSS can be compared with human appearance like hair colour, face shape, etc. i.e giving looks or styling. Similar is the CSS which deals with the appearance of the website. And, Javascript can be compared with body functionality, i.e working of different system in our body such as respiratory system, digestive system and many more. And here Javascript is used for making website interactive.

After learning these basics, your next step would be - **learning CSS frameworks**.
Several additional features could be implemented on the website by using CSS frameworks. 

You can learn any CSS Frameworks such as
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind CSS
- Bulma

After CSS frameworks, the next step can be **learning CSS Preprocessors**.

The CSS preprocessors extends CSS and then it is compiled to regular CSS. Using CSS preprocessors, developers can use variables, functions, etc. in their CSS code.

The popular CSS preprocessors includes
- SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet) [ For preventing duplication Sass follows the principle - **DRY** ( Here, DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself) ]

- LESS (Leaner Style Sheets)
- Stylus

After CSS Preprocessors, another step would be learning - **Javascript Framework**. 

You could learn any Javascript Framework such as
- React
- Angular
- Vue.js
- Node.js
- Ember.js

These Javascript framework has their own unique features. Hence regarding choosing Framework, first of all you should know about the requirement in the project you are doing, and then choose that framework which is best suitable for your project i.e which JS framework is required for developers to design their application.

Then comes learning, **State Management Libraries** such as NgRx then **learning Version Control System** and then **learning Testing**.

At last but not the least, you should **make your strong portfolio** where you showcase yours' skills and experiences.

Remember that, this is just a suggestion. Everyone has different journey. So, it is not compulsory to do the exact step by step in this order as mentioned above. After all, it all depends on what kind of project or job you are working with.

In addition to these, it is necessary to **have softskills** like leadership, problem-solving, communication skills, teamwork, etc.

***Bonus tip: Don't stress too much , and yes enjoy learning. This journey towards learning front-end web development is beautiful.***

***Happy learning!***

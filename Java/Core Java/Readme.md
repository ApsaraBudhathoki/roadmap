# Roadmap to becoming a Java Programmer

Java is one of the most popular programming language in the world. It is a high-level, platform independent object oriented programming language. Every java program in based on WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere). Know more about Java [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))

# What is Data Analysis?

The process of collecting and processing the raw data and preparing the required statistics are what data analysts do. Their job responsibilities rotate around this and it’s likely less typical than that of a Data Scientist. However, they play a very major role in taking business decisions (that being taken based on their extracted data and stats) and identifying the pain points of customers that eventually helps businesses in changing their approach for better growth.

## Responsibilities of Data Analyst

Well, that depends upon the type of organization that you’ll be working on because nowadays every industry is looking out for such professionals despite their size (small-medium-large). Although, some of the key responsibility includes:

- To develop and analyze the report
- To manage master data right (create -> update -> delete)
- To support the data warehousing in inspecting the reporting requirements.
- To troubleshoot the reporting DB environment and reports.
- Coordinating with developers, and engineers to gather insight for improvement and making modifications for data governance.
- Use of statistical tools to interpret data sets, and to follow any ongoing trend that could be valuable.

## Why Data Analyst?

Being a Data Analyst you will be working on real-life problem-solving scenarios and with this fast-paced, evolving technology, the demand for Data Analysts has grown enormously. Moving with this pace of advancement, the competition is growing every day and companies require new methods to compete for their existence and that’s what Data Analysts do.

Let’s understand in some simple ways:

- Being a Data Analyst, you’ll be working closely with the raw data and will generate valuable insights that will help companies to decide their future goals.
- If you’re someone who likes thinking out of the box then you are the perfect fit for this domain. Data Analysts help organizations to work with both business and data closely. This eventually maximizes the output for generating more business values.

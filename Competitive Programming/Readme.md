# Competitive Programming

## PreRequisites
Just Basic knowledge of Loops, Arrays and Strings in any language.
<br>

## To Do List (level wise) Starting from Scratch
### • 5-6 Pattern Printing Questions 
For absolute Beginners to strong their loops implementation first. <br><br>
RESOURCE - 
You can google "printing pattern questions in C++" for that and try unique patterns on your own in any language u prefer to use.

### • Try Basic Array and String Implementation Questions
Like reversing the array, checking palindrome making substring, etc. on your own. <br><br>
RESOURCE - Again -> Google "Basic Questions of Arrays"

## Start Doing CodeChef
Go to problem sections, Set Difficulty 0* and See how things works here and learn what is test case, what are constraints, how to submit etc. <br>
You can see any YouTube video if having problem In that. <br>
Practice 2-3 questions and you are good to go

## Practice
Set higher Difficulty say 1* Beginner Do Start practice them and practice .... till u start feeling comfortable with that much difficulty and the platform, <br>
Set more higher difficulty and do this until u start feeling stuck in the problems.

## "Life Starts at the end of your comfort zone".

## Start Giving Weekly Rated Contests, Specially CodeChef Long Challenge

Feel the adrenaline push and just do it, Without contests your growth will be slow paced so do attempt contest even if you feel losing. And after giving the contest do upsolve, because that's something that will help to improve you.

## Try Reading other's Code and Doubts
Try Improving your debugging skills, Everyone is able Debug their own code at your own but debugging and finding big in someone else's code is gonna improve your Debugging Skills much farther

## Topics to learn
Topics to learn are mentioned in very systematic order in this playlist. You can see topics names from here in order and can read them from wherever you want or maybe from this playlist too, It's your call wherever you like to learn. <br>

## Learn Along and Enjoy The Path
CP needs patience and time. Try to enjoy the path, Learn new Topics, new ways, and try implementing them in contests.

## Improve and Upsolve
Challenge yourself with higher difficulty range, don't lose hope, Take Contests on time and never give it up in the middle of the contest. They are designed that way that one question can even take 1-2 hours to solve, depending on you, if your lose your hope your are finished then. <br>
Improve your rankings and your comfort zone by practice and practice in Practice section and in contests.

## Time to Shift on CodeForces
When you reach 3 star rank you are ready to Shift to CodeForces if you want to. <br>
At some point you will also feel you have to shift to CodeForces so why not now and at this level you are ready to face the problems of there.

## Practice And Get Habitual of Codeforces
Go to ProblemSet and set difficulty 800 or 1000 and start getting comfortable with the problems of here and Start Attempting Contests.

## Don't Give Up
CodeForces is very Demotivating for start that's why I didn't advised you to Directly jump on it. <br>
Don't Lose Hope, just practice, one day you will be habitual of here also by practice.

## Make a LinkedIn Account and See others achieving something in CP
CP can be demotivating many times and way more motivating at times, <br>
LinkedIn family hels to get us a somewhat Balanced way to keep us motivated for cp so do use LinkedIn oftenly.

## Don't Run after Resources
Don't Run after Resources, Leetcode, CodeForces and CodeChef are enough for this. <br>
You can also prefer your own playlist or sheet it's completely fine, main thing is you should learn.

## Practice, Get Comfortable, Set Higher Difficulty
Practice many same difficulty questions until you feel comfortable and feel that you can do any question with this difficulty level now.
When you get that feeling, Set one level Higher Difficulty and start getting comfortable with that level and you are good to go.

## Requirements to achieve higher level
1) Your Logic Building (that comes by practice)
2) Greedy Methods (That you will automatically learn by Practice)
3) Topics Mentioned in the playlist specially STL.
4) Advanced Topics Like DP, Graphs doesn't get asked till Specialist Rank on CodeForce or 3* rank on CodeChef, to reach one step further form that, then you need DP and basic understandings of Graphs
and for higher ranks you will definitely need topics like Graphs, Segment Trees etc.

## Rock On
These all are the tips you can follow, Running after any clickbaits like do this in just a month or in this amout of days isn't gonna help in cp much, some tips are genuine that comes from great achivers of cp that can be followed but following any random clickbait and follow isn't gonna help you

## You know your self better, make your way.

There's a saying,
## "Listen to Everyone, but do the way you would like do"
Follow that

## FAQ 
## Is this enough to get good ranks in Google Kickstart Competitions also
Yes the same topics and difficulties get asked in these competetions like Google Kickstart and Meta Hacker Cup.<br>

For ICPC, yeah you will need much more from this for that but if u can reach till this level, you can definitely go that level too so don't get disheartened or loose hope

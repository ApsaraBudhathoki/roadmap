# Python Roadmap

## What to Learn in Python?

- Learn the basics. Learn about its history, syntax, installation, and some basic constructs like statements, variables, and operators.
- Find out about the applications of Python. Also, understand the differences between Python 2 and Python 3.
- Learn about basic data structures like lists, sets, and dictionaries.
- Understand important concepts like decision making and loops.
- Learn how to create a virtual environment.
- Move on to functions and recursion.
- Get started with object-oriented concepts like classes and methods, and inheritance and overloading.
- Find out about modules and packages, and get some experience with common modules like os, namedtuple, and calendar.
- Learn file handling. Learn about more complex topics like generators and decorators, and shallow and deep copying.
- Also, learn to generate and use random numbers and regular expressions.
- Learn about more complex topics like networking, XML processing, and multiprocessing.
- Learn to build GUIs with Python.
- Find out about exceptions and how to handle them.
- Learn to use SciPy, NumPy, and Pandas.
- Learn to debug, unit-test, log, serialize, and access the database.

## Who is a Good Python Developer?

To be a good Python developer, you will need more than just technical knowledge and the following skills

- A problem-solving mindset
- Strong communication skills- You’ll need to communicate project requirements and features to your team. This will also help you write better documentation.
- An eagerness to learn new tools and libraries
- Knowledge of how things work internally
- Strong technical skills

### Roadmap checkpoints

#### 1. Learn Syntax and Basics

- The Python shell, basic arithmetic.
- Control structures.
- Accepting user input, Strings & Typecasting.
- Looping in Python: For & While loops.
- Exception handling.
- Functions, modules & Imports.

#### 2. OOPs Concepts, Built-in Data Structures, and Other Stuff

- Object-oriented programming in Python
- Lists & List functions
- Regular Expressions
- List comprehension
- List slicing
- String formatting
- Lambdas
- List, Dictionaries & Tuples

Once you mastered the above topics and practiced enough every topic it’s time to build something out of it. Python has a good collection of modules, packages, libraries, and frameworks that you may use for various applications. Pick up the framework or libraries as per your end goal (Web development, desktop-based applications, etc.)

#### 3. Frameworks for Web Development

- **Django:** A high-level web framework mostly used in startups and enterprises for web development. It follows the MVC pattern and you can use multiple databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle.

- **Flask:** Flask is one of the easiest microframeworks to learn in Python. If you wish to develop a simple and lightweight web application then Flask is suitable for that. It is not as powerful and extensive as Django but still provides features such as support for unit testing and building REST APIs.

#### 4. For Building Desktop Applications

- **Tkinter:** Tkinter is an open-source library and it allows you to build desktop GUI applications using Python. Learning Tkinter is simple and provides a graphical interface.

- **PyQT:** PyQt is one of the most powerful cross-platform GUI libraries owned by Nokia. It combines Python programming and the Qt library.

- **Kivy:** It can be used to create desktop applications also it supports platforms like Android, iOS, Linux & Raspberry Pi.

#### 5. For Data Analysis

- **Numpy:** It is an array-processing package and provides a high-performance array object. It is widely used for scientific computing with Python and provides essential features.
- **Pandas:** Pandas is also a very good open-source library that is used for data analysis. It provides high-level data structures (such as DataFrame) and a vast variety of tools for analysis. It also can translate complex operations into a few commands.

#### 6. For Machine Learning:

- **TensorFlow:** Most popular deep learning library developed by Google. It is a computational framework used to express algorithms that involve numerous Tensor operations.
- **Scikit-Learn:** A machine learning library for Python, designed to work with numerical libraries such as SciPy & NumPy.
- **PyTorch:** It can handle dynamic computation graphs on the go. It also provides easy to use API.

### Build Projects

- Simple interest/ EMI calculator,
- Weather application
- Simple Crawler
- E-commerce site
- Online CV generator, and so on

 **Best of Luck!**
